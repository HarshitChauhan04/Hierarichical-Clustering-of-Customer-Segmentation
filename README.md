# Hierarichical-Clustering-of-Customer-Segmentation

Hierarchical Clustering Analysis groups customers based on annual income and spending score using dendrograms and agglomerative clustering. The project includes data exploration, visualization, and Python implementation, helping identify customer segments for targeted marketing and business insights.

# üß† Objective

The goal of this project is to:

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer data

Use Hierarchical Clustering to group customers based on key features

Visualize customer clusters using dendrograms and scatter plots

Provide insights into each customer segment‚Äôs characteristics

# Data Source Infromation
The dataset consists of 200 customer records from a mall‚Äôs customer database.
Each record includes: CustomerID, Genre, Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1-100).
Data is used to segment customers based on spending behavior and income for targeted marketing.
Original data file: data/customers.csv

# üß∞ Tools & Technologies

Python: Programming language

Pandas: Data manipulation

Matplotlib / Seaborn: Visualization

Scikit-learn: Machine learning tools

Scipy: For dendrograms and linkage methods

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive data analysis

# üîç Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Scaling numerical features (StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Scatter Plot,Boxplot

Correlation heatmaps

3. Hierarchical Clustering

Use dendrograms to determine optimal number of clusters

Cut the dendrogram at an appropriate level to form clusters

# Impacts & Insights
Customer Behavior Understanding: Identifies distinct customer groups based on spending and income patterns, enabling targeted marketing.

Business Strategy Optimization: Helps tailor promotions, product offerings, and services to specific customer segments.

Data-Driven Decisions: Supports segmentation-driven decisions that improve customer satisfaction and retention.

Visual Exploration: Dendrogram and cluster plots make complex relationships easier to interpret.

Scalable Framework: Approach can be expanded to include more features or other clustering algorithms for deeper insights.
